//we ne3ed to become the admin of the Puzzel wallet
//The puzzel wallet and puzzleproxy share the same storage
// to become admin we need to set maxbalance to attacker address as both share slot 1 storage
// there are two ways to set maxbalance init() or SetMxBalance()
//we can not call init() because maxbalance is already set
//to call SetMaxBalamce() we must be onlyWhitelisted
// to be onlyWhitelisted we must call addToWhitelist ,but it can only be called by the owner
//we can set proposeNewAdmin(attacker) so that attacker can become owner because both share same slot 0
//after becoming the owner we can call addToWhitelist(attacker) to become onlyWhitelisted
//we still cannot call SetMaxBalance() because the balance of the contract is 0.01eth
// we need to make the balance of the contract to 0
//we can do this by calling the  multicall() passing the deposit selector,but we can call deposit only once\
//we can call 2 times multicall() in multicall() so that we can deposit 0.01 eth two times
//we can see that attacker can withdraw 0.02 eth even though he deposited only 0.01 eth using execute()
//so the balance of the contract is 0,now call SetMaxBalance(attacker)
//maxbalance and the admin share the same slot 1,so admin=attacker
//HACKED
